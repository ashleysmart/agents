# Create Pull Request Skill

## Pre-flight

1. **Ensure clean state** — run in parallel:
   - `git status` (no unexpected changes)
   - `git log --oneline main..HEAD` (commits to include)
   - `git diff main...HEAD --stat` (files changed)

2. **Run all checks** — detect language from changed files, run in parallel. See `tooling/TOOLING.md` / `tooling/TOOLING_<lang>.md` for per-language commands.
   - Lint
   - Format — if it fails, auto-fix and commit the result
   - Typecheck — ignore pre-existing errors in untouched files
   - Tests

3. **Fix before proceeding** — do NOT create the PR if lint, format, or tests fail on changed files.

## Branch prep

1. **Rebase on main**:
   ```bash
   git fetch --prune
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout <branch> && git rebase main
   ```
   - Resolve conflicts: prefer main's version for files with no intentional changes. For files we changed, merge carefully.
   - Re-run checks after rebase.

2. **Squash if requested** — `git reset --soft main && git commit -m "message"`

3. **Push**:
   - First push: `git push -u origin <branch>`
   - After rebase/squash: `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>`
   - Never force push without `--force-with-lease`
   - Never push to main/master

## PR description

**Template selection:** Check the repo's AGENTS.md and `.github/pull_request_template.md` (or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`) for a repo-specific PR template. If one exists, use it. Otherwise, fall back to `@DEFAULT_PR.md`.

Use a HEREDOC with a `mktemp` file prefixed `<repo>_PR<number>_` (concurrent agents share /tmp — never hardcode the name):

```bash
REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
TMPFILE=$(mktemp "/tmp/${REPO}_PR<number>_XXXXXX.md")
cat <<'PREOF' > "$TMPFILE"
<body content>
PREOF
gh pr create --title "title" --body-file "$TMPFILE"
rm "$TMPFILE"
```

### Title conventions
- Under 70 characters
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- Use description for details, not the title

### Description rules
- Lead with WHY, not WHAT
- List all changed files/endpoints/components in a structured table if the PR is large
- Explicitly list what was NOT changed and why (scope boundaries)
- If there are pre-existing issues in untouched files, note them as out of scope
- Link to spec if one exists
- Update the description when the PR changes — stale descriptions cause review friction. Updates follow "Updating an existing PR" below: surgical edits, never a rewrite.

## Updating an existing PR

**NEVER regenerate the body from scratch or from memory.** A heredoc rewrite destroys links, checklists, and prior content. Always fetch the live body, edit it surgically, and diff before pushing:

```bash
REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
TMPFILE=$(mktemp "/tmp/${REPO}_PR<number>_XXXXXX.md")
gh pr view <number> --json body --jq .body > "$TMPFILE.orig"
cp "$TMPFILE.orig" "$TMPFILE"
# edit $TMPFILE — targeted edits only (sed or editor)
diff "$TMPFILE.orig" "$TMPFILE"
gh pr edit <number> --body-file "$TMPFILE"
rm "$TMPFILE" "$TMPFILE.orig"
```

- Edit only the sections your change affects; every other line stays byte-identical.
- Keep the template structure — never remove or rename template headings.
- Preserve every link (spec, issue, docs, commit) verbatim. Removing a link requires an explicit user instruction.
- The `diff` step is mandatory: if it shows anything beyond the intended change, fix the file before `gh pr edit`.
- Re-read and verify after updating — `gh pr view <number> --json body --jq .body` and confirm every link from the old body is still present.
- Only update the description when asked, or when your own code change made it stale. If asked to do something else (e.g., flip off draft), do NOT rewrite the description as a side effect — report the staleness and ask.

## Commit conventions

### Message format
```
type(scope): concise description of why

Optional body with details.

```

Always use HEREDOC for multi-line messages:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): description

Body text here.

)"
```

### Staging rules
- `git add <specific-files>` — never `git add -A` or `git add .`
- Only commit files relevant to the change
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, or large binaries

### Amend vs new commit
- Amend: only when squashing into a single commit (user requested)
- New commit: default — separate logical changes get separate commits
- After pre-commit hook failure: always NEW commit (the failed commit didn't happen, amending would modify the previous commit)

## Post-creation

1. Verify the PR was created: `gh pr view <number> --json url --jq .url`
2. Return the PR URL to the user
3. Do NOT merge unless explicitly asked

## Rules

- Never push without user approval
- Never force push to main/master
- Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`) — sole exception: red-light test commits per the carve-out in `~/agents/CODER.md` §5 step 7
- Never create empty commits
- Always run lint + format + typecheck + tests before creating/updating a PR
- Temp files: `mktemp` with a `<repo>_PR<number>_` prefix — never hardcoded paths (concurrent agents overwrite each other)
- Keep the PR description in sync with the actual code — update it when changes are made
- Never replace a PR body wholesale — fetch, edit surgically, diff, then push (see "Updating an existing PR")
- Never delete links or template sections from a PR body without an explicit user instruction
- If the PR description references endpoints, components, or features, verify they exist in the diff
