# Agent Tasking — reading the spec, writing the tasking file

Agent rules for the tasking file. The human spec's convention — tiers, location, shape — is `HUMAN_SPECS.md`; the agent reads that spec and writes `agent_tasking.md` beside it.

## Objective

- Capture the design requirements and goals.
- Capture the acceptance requirements.
- The spec is where the problem is thought through before building — not a task brief for an agent.
  - It states what is being solved, what is assumed, where the boundary is, and how success is measured.
  - It never states how the job is done — the approach, the alternatives and why not, and the tasks are the tasking file's (§ Implementation approach, § Implementation tasks).
- Written in terse-srp-dot-point style (`~/agents/style/DOT_POINT_SRP.md`): every line under a heading is a `-` dot point, one clause per line, sub-clauses nested; no paragraphs, no hand-wrapped prose.
- The spec is **not** a code-in-text-form document.
  - It does not perfectly represent the exact code that is written.
  - It documents the objective of the happy path.
  - It documents the main exceptions to the happy path in a generalized way.
- Use function and class names, not hand-waving terms, to discuss target code.
- Statements follow SOLID (`~/agents/style/DOT_POINT_SRP.md` § SOLID statements); open/closed is the rule agent specs most often break.
  - Each requirement, design line, and acceptance criterion states what this change adds or does.
  - It does not enumerate the module's full set of behaviours — that inventory goes stale when parallel work lands on the same module.
  - GOOD: "`RecordAdapter` will add `browse(cursor)`".
  - BAD: "`RecordAdapter` has `create`, `browse`".
- Code references are quick-ref (`~/agents/style/QUICK_REF.md`), or code-snip (`~/agents/style/CODE_SNIP.md`) where a claim rests on the code.

## Authorship

- The human owns the spec's content; the agent may hold the pen — the `task.md` contract (`review/TASK_FILE.md`).
  - The agent drafts from the human's words, near-verbatim, formatted into the tier shape; it shows the draft and writes on approval.
  - Allowed: grammar, spelling, expanding shorthand, placing text under the right heading.
  - Not allowed: rephrasing, summarising, or adding content the human did not say — no invented requirements, design, or alternatives.
- The agent's own analysis goes in the tasking file (§ Tasking file) — the approach, the alternatives, and the task list are the agent's, never the spec's.
- A gap or conflict in the spec → the agent asks; the human supplies the words.

| # | Section | Lives in | Author | Agent rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Problem | Spec | Human | Human's words — what is wrong. Missing or empty → tasking does not start; ask. |
| 2 | Objective | Spec | Human | Human's words — `**Decision:**` and `**Success:**`. Missing → ask. |
| — | Terms | Spec | Human | Optional. Human's words. Defines a term the spec leans on. |
| 3 | Requirements | Spec | Human | Human's words. Numbered checklist (`R<id>`). Missing or empty → tasking does not start; ask. |
| 4 | Scope | Spec | Human | Human's words. Missing boundary → ask. |
| 5 | Acceptance Criteria | Spec | Human | Human's words. Numbered checklist (`AC<id>`). |
| 6 | Verification | Spec | Human | Human's words. |
| 7 | Related | Spec | Human | Human's words. Append-only. |
| 8 | Implementation approach | Tasking file | Agent | The reuse, the minimal change, the trade-off, the alternatives and why not. |
| 9 | Implementation tasks | Tasking file | Agent | Numbered checklist (`T<id>`). Ordered by dependency. Human reads end to end before work starts. |
| 10 | Test plan | Tasking file | Agent | Derive from requirements. Human reads for completeness. |
| 11 | Security checklist | Tasking file | Agent | Numbered checklist (`S<id>`). Agent checks before completion. Human verifies. |

- Ids: `R` requirement and `AC` acceptance criterion in the spec; `T` task and `S` security check in the tasking file.

## Tasking file

- The tasking file ("tasking") is the agent's spec — the spec document the agent writes: `specs/<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>/agent_tasking.md`, beside the human spec (`HUMAN_SPECS.md` § File location).
- The agent owns it; humans read and approve it.
- It references the human spec by `R<id>` / `AC<id>`; it does not restate requirements.
- It holds the agent-authored sections (8–11) and the agent's derived artifacts, including:
  - Gap assumptions (`CODER.md` §1).
  - The input-state × behaviour matrix when the spec lacks one (P1).
  - The anti-pattern check (P3).
  - The acceptance-criterion → test mapping (P2).
  - Open questions for the human.
- Same style and tracker rules as the spec: terse-srp-dot-point throughout (§ Objective), not a tracker (§ The tasking file is not a tracker). `/check-spec` rejects prose lines in it.
- Its commit is separate from code commits.
- The tasking phase ends the turn with the tasking file pushed and an approval request (`CODER.md` §5 Two phases).
- It is a draft until a human has read it end to end and approved it explicitly in the thread or PR.
  - Silence is not approval; "confirmed offline" is not approval.
  - The agent records where the approval is.
- Spec and tasking work is exempt from the token-scope rule — deliberate as long as the design needs.

## Tasking file sections

The agent-authored sections. The human sections — problem, objective, requirements, scope, acceptance criteria, verification, related — are `HUMAN_SPECS.md`.

### 8. Implementation approach (agent — tasking file)

How the job gets done. The spec states what is required; this states the way there.

- The existing component reused and the minimal change on top of it.
- The material trade-off, and the rollback if it goes wrong.
- `Alternatives:` the other ways considered and why not, one line each — the minimal fix is one of them.

### 9. Implementation tasks (agent — tasking file)

Checklist of implementation steps, numbered for tracking. One line per task, ordered by dependency — foundations first. No time estimates.

Format:

```markdown
- [ ] **T1 — Split monolithic controller into domain-specific packages** - <what changes>
  - Files: <modules affected>
  - Depends on: —
  - Verification: <what proves it done>
- [ ] **T2 — Extract Knative Service template builder** - <what changes>
  - Files: <modules affected>
  - Depends on: T1
  - Verification: <what proves it done>
```

- Every sub-line is a nested dot point — `/check-spec` rejects indented prose continuations.

One commit per task. The checklist is the progress tracker.

### 10. Test plan (agent — tasking file)

Every requirement is covered. The plan is a floor, not a ceiling — implementation derives more tests than it names (see § Acceptance criteria are guides, not inventories).

- Every requirement has at least one test.
- The plan names groups of testing, never the test inventory.
- Happy path per requirement
- Error cases from the spec's requirements
- Boundary conditions: zero, one, max
- Design-mandated test constraints and pins earn a line; routine case enumeration does not.

### 11. Security checklist (agent — tasking file; human verifies)

Agent checks these before marking work complete. Human verifies during review. Numbered for tracking.

Format:

```markdown
- [ ] S1: No secrets, keys, or credentials in code or config files
- [ ] S2: All user input validated and sanitized at the boundary
```

Default items (include in every tasking file):

- [ ] S1: No secrets, keys, or credentials in code or config files
- [ ] S2: All user input validated and sanitized at the boundary
- [ ] S3: Auth required on every endpoint — no silent fallback to anonymous
- [ ] S4: Authorization checked: caller can only access their own resources
- [ ] S5: No SQL injection, command injection, or XSS vectors
- [ ] S6: Sensitive data not logged or exposed in error messages
- [ ] S7: Dependencies have no known critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] S8: File paths, URLs, and redirects cannot be manipulated by user input
- [ ] S9: Rate limiting or abuse protection on public-facing endpoints
- [ ] S10: Multi-tenant: resources scoped by tenant — no cross-tenant access

Add project-specific items from `@review/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` when applicable. Continue numbering from S11.

## Validation

- `/check-spec` (`~/agents/skills/CHECK_SPEC.md`) checks a spec directory against this document: `scripts/validate_spec.py` for the mechanical rules, then a judgment pass.
- The coder runs it before asking for tasking approval; the reviewer runs it before verifying P1–P3.
- A spec that fails it is a draft.

## Acceptance criteria are guides, not inventories

- An acceptance criterion states a set of claims and clauses to check.
- Each criterion defines a group of testing and checks, not a single test.
- Each criterion derives at least one test at implementation — usually more.
- Criteria list the important happy paths and the important edge cases.
  - Including happy paths or edge cases found missing in a coding pass.
- Criteria detail only what they need to; they are not exhaustive of the code.
- Leave criteria as generalizations where appropriate.
- The code and tests will exceed the criteria — the spec never reads as the ceiling of testing.
- Do not enumerate the actual tests in the spec — that is the code-in-text-form failure.
  - Only design-mandated test constraints and pins earn spec space.

## The tasking file is not a tracker

- Like the spec (`HUMAN_SPECS.md` § The spec is not a tracker), the tasking file states the target contract — the settled truth, written as if it had always been so.
- The spec is never a status tracker, changelog, worklog, or review-claim litigation record.
- No status markers in spec prose: no `DONE`, `Status:`, `REVERTED`, `NOT IMPLEMENTED`, no "at spec phase".
- No edit history in spec prose: no "corrected", "rewritten", "was X now Y", no rebuttal of review claims.
- When a section changes, rewrite it to the new truth and delete the old text.
- A reader must not be able to tell from any section what order it was written in.
- Each kind of record has its own home — never the spec:
  - What changed and when → git history of the spec file.
  - Why a direction was chosen or reversed → `task.md` `# DECISIONS` (`review/TASK_FILE.md`).
  - Review claims and their outcomes → the review store `<ID>.md` files (ISSUE_TRACKING.md).
  - Implementation progress → the implementation-task checkboxes (`T<id>`) in the tasking file, checkbox state only.
- The tracking surfaces are the numbered checklists — R/AC in the spec, T/S in the tasking file — checkbox flips, not prose annotations.

## Rules

- Spec is the source of truth. Code out to the spec's intended target, filling
  in-scope gaps with the established conventions (fail-closed for security,
  SOLID for design, the coding standards) rather than prompting for
  micro-requirements. Only ask when those conventions give no clear answer.
  A change of code direction is recorded in the tasking file (small drift) or
  asked about (large divergence) — the agent does not rewrite the spec. See
  CODER.md §1 for the full divergence-by-size rule.
- Every requirement must be verifiable.
- Keep all sections in sync. A gap between them is a bug in the spec.
