# Design Patterns

## Creational
- [Abstract Factory](design-patterns/abstract-factory.md) — Create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- [Builder](design-patterns/builder.md) — Construct a complex object step-by-step; separate construction from representation
- [Factory Method](design-patterns/factory-method.md) — Delegate instantiation to a subclass or factory function; callers depend on the interface, not the concrete type
- [Lazy Initialisation](design-patterns/lazy-initialisation.md) — Delay creation of an object or computation of a value until the first time it is needed
- [Multiton](design-patterns/multiton.md) — Like Singleton but keyed — one instance per named key, managed by the class itself
- [Object Pool](design-patterns/object-pool.md) — Reuse a fixed set of expensive objects rather than creating and destroying them per use
- [Prototype](design-patterns/prototype.md) — Clone an existing object rather than constructing from scratch
- [Singleton](design-patterns/singleton.md) — Ensure a class has exactly one instance; prefer dependency injection over global access

## Structural
- [Adapter](design-patterns/adapter.md) — Wrap an incompatible interface so it matches the one a client expects
- [Bridge](design-patterns/bridge.md) — Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so both can vary independently
- [Composite](design-patterns/composite.md) — Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly through a shared interface
- [Decorator](design-patterns/decorator.md) — Add behaviour to an object at runtime by wrapping it; preserves the interface
- [Facade](design-patterns/facade.md) — Provide a simplified interface over a complex subsystem
- [Flyweight](design-patterns/flyweight.md) — Share fine-grained objects to reduce memory when many instances share state
- [Module](design-patterns/module.md) — Group related functions, types, and state behind a single cohesive interface; hide internals
- [Proxy](design-patterns/proxy.md) — Control access to an object — for lazy init, access control, or caching

## Behavioural
- [Chain of Responsibility](design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility.md) — Pass a request along a chain of handlers; each handler decides to process or forward
- [Command](design-patterns/command.md) — Encapsulate a request as an object; enables undo, queuing, and logging
- [Interpreter](design-patterns/interpreter.md) — Define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter to evaluate sentences in it
- [Iterator](design-patterns/iterator.md) — Provide sequential access to elements without exposing the underlying structure
- [Mediator](design-patterns/mediator.md) — Centralise communication between objects to reduce direct dependencies
- [Memento](design-patterns/memento.md) — Capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation
- [Null Object](design-patterns/null-object.md) — Provide a do-nothing implementation of an interface to eliminate null checks at call sites
- [Observer](design-patterns/observer.md) — Notify dependents automatically when an object's state changes
- [Specification](design-patterns/specification.md) — Encapsulate a business rule as a composable predicate object; combine with and/or/not
- [State](design-patterns/state.md) — Allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes
- [Strategy](design-patterns/strategy.md) — Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each, and make them interchangeable
- [Template Method](design-patterns/template-method.md) — Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class; let subclasses fill in steps
- [Visitor](design-patterns/visitor.md) — Add operations to an object structure without modifying the classes of its elements

## Architectural
- [Active Record](design-patterns/active-record.md) — Wrap a database row in a domain object that also handles its own load, save, and delete
- [Anti-Corruption Layer](design-patterns/anti-corruption-layer.md) — Translate between two different domain models at an integration boundary so neither corrupts the other
- [Broker](design-patterns/broker.md) — Decouple clients from servers through an intermediary that locates servers, routes requests, and forwards results
- [Data Mapper](design-patterns/data-mapper.md) — Map between domain objects and database rows without coupling either side to the other
- [Event-Driven Architecture](design-patterns/event-driven-architecture.md) — Components communicate exclusively through events; producers and consumers are fully decoupled
- [Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)](design-patterns/hexagonal-architecture.md) — Isolate the domain from all external concerns behind ports; adapters implement the ports for specific technologies
- [Layered Architecture](design-patterns/layered-architecture.md) — Organise code into horizontal layers with dependencies flowing downward only
- [Microservices](design-patterns/microservices.md) — Decompose an application into small, independently deployable services, each owning its data and business capability
- [Pipe and Filter](design-patterns/pipe-and-filter.md) — Process data through a sequence of independent processing steps (filters) connected by channels (pipes)
- [Repository](design-patterns/repository.md) — Abstract persistence behind a collection-like interface; domain does not know about storage
- [Service Layer](design-patterns/service-layer.md) — Define an application's boundary with a layer of services that establishes available operations and coordinates responses
- [Service Object](design-patterns/service-object.md) — Encapsulate a single business operation in a stateless object with one public method
- [Space-Based Architecture](design-patterns/space-based-architecture.md) — Eliminate the database as a bottleneck by storing all shared state in an in-memory data grid distributed across processing units
- [Strangler Fig](design-patterns/strangler-fig.md) — Incrementally replace a legacy system by routing requests to new implementation; retire the old gradually
- [Unit of Work](design-patterns/unit-of-work.md) — Track all changes made during a transaction and write them out as a single atomic operation

## Concurrency
- [Active Object](design-patterns/active-object.md) — Decouple method invocation from execution; calls are queued and executed asynchronously in the object's own thread
- [Future / Promise](design-patterns/future-promise.md) — A proxy for a result not yet computed; the computation proceeds concurrently while the caller may continue or block when the result is needed
- [Half-Sync/Half-Async](design-patterns/half-sync-half-async.md) — Separate synchronous and asynchronous processing layers with a queue between them
- [Monitor Object](design-patterns/monitor-object.md) — Synchronise concurrent method execution so only one method runs at a time within an object

- [Reactor](design-patterns/reactor.md) — Handle service requests dispatched concurrently by demultiplexing events and dispatching to registered handlers
- [Read-Write Lock](design-patterns/read-write-lock.md) — Allow multiple concurrent readers or one exclusive writer; readers never block each other
- [Scheduler](design-patterns/scheduler.md) — Control the order in which threads access shared resources based on a defined policy

- [Content-Based Router](design-patterns/content-based-router.md) — Route a message to a different channel based on its content
- [Correlation Identifier](design-patterns/correlation-identifier.md) — Attach a unique ID to a request so that replies can be matched back to the original request
- [Dead Letter Channel](design-patterns/dead-letter-channel.md) — Move unprocessable messages to a holding channel for investigation rather than discarding them
- [Message Store](design-patterns/message-store.md) — Persist messages to a central store for auditing, replay, and debugging without disrupting the primary flow
- [Process Manager](design-patterns/process-manager.md) — Maintain state and coordinate a multi-step workflow across multiple channels and services
- [Request-Reply](design-patterns/request-reply.md) — Send a message and receive a reply on a known reply channel, achieving synchronous semantics over async messaging
- [Routing Slip](design-patterns/routing-slip.md) — Attach a list of processing steps to a message; each processor removes itself from the slip and forwards to the next
- [Scatter-Gather](design-patterns/scatter-gather.md) — Broadcast a request to multiple recipients and aggregate their replies into a single response
- [Splitter](design-patterns/splitter.md) — Split a composite message into individual messages for separate downstream processing
- [Wire Tap](design-patterns/wire-tap.md) — Intercept messages on a channel for logging or monitoring without disrupting the primary flow

## Distributed
- [Ambassador](design-patterns/ambassador.md) — Proxy network calls from the main service through a helper that handles retries, circuit breaking, and observability
- [API Gateway](design-patterns/api-gateway.md) — Single entry point for all clients that routes to backend services, handles auth, and aggregates responses
- [Backends for Frontends (BFF)](design-patterns/backends-for-frontends.md) — Separate backend API surface per client type to serve each client's specific needs
- [Blue-Green Deployment](design-patterns/blue-green-deployment.md) — Maintain two identical environments; switch all traffic between them for zero-downtime deployments and instant rollback
- [Bulkhead](design-patterns/bulkhead.md) — Isolate components into pools so a failure in one pool does not exhaust resources for others
- [Canary Release](design-patterns/canary-release.md) — Route a small percentage of traffic to a new version of a service; monitor before rolling out fully
- [Change Data Capture (CDC)](design-patterns/change-data-capture.md) — Capture row-level changes from a database and publish them as events to downstream consumers
- [Choreography](design-patterns/choreography.md) — Services react to events with no central coordinator; each service knows what to do when it receives an event
- [Circuit Breaker](design-patterns/circuit-breaker.md) — Stop calling a failing service after a threshold; reset after a cool-down period
- [Compensating Transaction](design-patterns/compensating-transaction.md) — Undo a completed step in a distributed workflow by applying a semantically inverse operation
- [Competing Consumers](design-patterns/competing-consumers.md) — Multiple consumer instances read from the same queue; each message processed by exactly one consumer
- [CQRS](design-patterns/cqrs.md) — Separate read and write models; reads use a denormalised projection, writes go through a command handler
- [Distributed Tracing](design-patterns/distributed-tracing.md) — Attach a trace ID to a request and collect timing spans from every service it touches to reconstruct the full execution path
- [Event Sourcing](design-patterns/event-sourcing.md) — Store state as an append-only sequence of events; current state is derived by replaying them

- [Feature Toggle](design-patterns/feature-toggle.md) — Enable or disable features at runtime without deploying new code
- [Health Endpoint Monitoring](design-patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring.md) — Expose a dedicated endpoint that reports service health; consumed by load balancers and orchestrators
- [Idempotent Consumer](design-patterns/idempotent-consumer.md) — Ensure processing a message more than once has the same effect as processing it once
- [Inbox](design-patterns/inbox.md) — Store incoming messages in a local inbox table and process them exactly once, even if the same message is delivered multiple times
- [Leader Election](design-patterns/leader-election.md) — Designate one node as coordinator for a task; remaining nodes stand by and take over on failure
- [Outbox](design-patterns/outbox.md) — Write events to a local outbox table in the same transaction as the domain write; a relay process forwards them to the broker
- [Publisher-Subscriber](design-patterns/publisher-subscriber.md) — Producers publish to topics; consumers subscribe independently; producers and consumers are fully decoupled
- [Read Replicas](design-patterns/read-replicas.md) — Route read queries to replicas of the primary to offload read load and improve throughput
- [Retry with Backoff](design-patterns/retry-with-backoff.md) — Re-attempt a failed operation with increasing delays; cap total attempts
- [Saga](design-patterns/saga.md) — Coordinate a long-running transaction across services using local transactions with compensating actions on failure
- [Service Discovery](design-patterns/service-discovery.md) — Services register their network location; clients query a registry to find them rather than using hard-coded addresses
- [Sharding](design-patterns/sharding.md) — Partition data across multiple storage nodes by a shard key to distribute load and storage
- [Sidecar](design-patterns/sidecar.md) — Deploy a helper process alongside the main service to handle cross-cutting concerns

- [Valet Key](design-patterns/valet-key.md) — Grant a client a time-limited, scoped token to access a resource directly without routing through the service
- [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](design-patterns/write-ahead-log.md) — Write changes to a durable log before applying them to the data structure; enables crash recovery and replication

## UI / Presentation
- [Flux / Redux](design-patterns/flux-redux.md) — Unidirectional data flow — actions describe what happened, a dispatcher routes them, a store updates state, the view re-renders from state
- [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](design-patterns/mvc.md) — Separate data (model), display (view), and user input handling (controller) into distinct components
- [Model-View-Presenter (MVP)](design-patterns/mvp.md) — Like MVC but the presenter takes full control of the view; the view is passive
- [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](design-patterns/mvvm.md) — The view model exposes data and commands as observable streams that the view binds to declaratively
- [Presentation Model](design-patterns/presentation-model.md) — Extract all UI logic into a presentation model object; the view is a thin rendering shell
