# Big Ball of Mud

A system with no discernible architecture.

**Applies to**: Software Architecture

---

**What it is**: A system with no discernible architecture. Everything
depends on everything. Structure grew organically through patches and
shortcuts until none remains.

**Why not**: Impossible to reason about, test, or change in isolation.
Every modification risks breaking unrelated behaviour. The only fix is
incremental extraction with a clear target architecture.
