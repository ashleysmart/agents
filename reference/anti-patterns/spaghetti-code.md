# Spaghetti Code

Control flow jumps arbitrarily across functions and modules with no clear structure or layering.

**Applies to**: Software Design

**What it is**: Control flow jumps arbitrarily across functions and modules
with no clear structure or layering.

**Why not**: Impossible to reason about locally. A change in one place
breaks behaviour in an unrelated place. Cannot be unit tested in isolation.
