# Distributed Monolith

A system split into multiple services that are so tightly coupled — shared databases, synchronous call chains, coordinated deploys — that they cannot be developed or deployed independently.

**Applies to**: Distributed Systems

---

**What it is**: A system split into multiple services that are so tightly
coupled — shared databases, synchronous call chains, coordinated deploys —
that they cannot be developed or deployed independently.

**Why not**: Captures the operational complexity of microservices with none
of the independence benefits. A failure in one service cascades to all.
