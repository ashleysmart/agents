# Abstraction Inversion

A high-level abstraction hides low-level primitives that users need, forcing them to re-implement those primitives on top of the abstraction.

**What it is**: A high-level abstraction hides low-level primitives that
users need, forcing them to re-implement those primitives on top of the
abstraction.

**Why not**: Users end up fighting the abstraction. The interface does too
much in the wrong direction — it hides power while adding complexity.
