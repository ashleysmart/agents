# Leaky Abstraction

An abstraction that exposes details of what it is hiding, forcing callers to understand the underlying implementation to use it correctly.

**Applies to**: Software Design

---

**What it is**: An abstraction that exposes details of what it is hiding,
forcing callers to understand the underlying implementation to use it correctly.

**Why not**: Defeats the purpose of the abstraction. Callers become coupled
to the implementation, so the abstraction cannot change independently.
